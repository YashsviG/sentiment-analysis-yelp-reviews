They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to go Our server same is very friendly and recognized us every single timeNow I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre Raw oysters are not cleaned well So if your schedule is flexible go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 centsoyster  better quality and cheaper Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felixs A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow maybe boiled for too long?

Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in after all we are your best customers we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting Carr   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter five as I recall   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldnt even be covered let alone if we bring a guest!

I highly recommend them to everyone!"}
