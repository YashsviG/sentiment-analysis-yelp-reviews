We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \n\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker."}

From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\n\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\n\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!"}

All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel."}

Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!"}
